       <p>Today, the rate of extinction is occurring 1,000 to 10,000 <br>
       faster because of human activity. The main modern causes of <br>
       extinction are the loss and degradation of habitat (mainly <br>
       deforestation), over exploitation (hunting, overfishing), <br>
       invasive species, climate change, and nitrogen pollution</p>

           extinction reason Species become endangered <br>
           for two main reasons: loss of habitat and <br>
           loss of genetic variation. A loss of habitat can<br>
            happen naturally. Dinosaurs, for instance, <br>lost their habitat
             about 65 million years ago.

      <p>Even reducing meat intake has a protective effect.<br>
         Research shows that people who eat red meat are at an<br>
          increased risk of death from heart disease, stroke or<br>
           diabetes. Processed meats also increase the risk of <br>
           death from these diseases. And what you don't eat can<br>
            also harm your health</p>

               Myth. According to the National Institutes<br>
                of Health, a number of studies over the years<br>
                 linked red meat with an increased risk of cardio <br>
                 vascular disease, some cancers, and diabetes. But<br>
                  other research shows that a low level of consumption <br>
                  – no more than 2-3 servings per week – is not deter<br>

      <p>n the lab, researchers found that animals,<br>
         like chickens and rats, self-administer<br>
          pain relievers (from special machines set<br>
           up for tests) when they're hurting. And in<br>
            general, animals tend to avoid situations <br>
            in which they've been hurt before —<br>
